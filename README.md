Class 3 activity 1
My name is Priscilla! I'm a data operations analyst and I love yoga, longboarding and crocheting.

When I grow up, I want to be a quant trader.

I chose FintTech as a career path because I want to integrate technological solutions to make my work more effective and innovative.

Just adding more stuff.
